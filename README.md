Image classification with 7 class

Create a main folder with 7 class subfolders. Each subfolder contains a different image. Due to classification, the dataset must contain images in closeup or dominant in the frame. Don't forget to resize the images to 448x448 or 640x640.

Suggestions for the future, a very different negative dataset should be added, for example, the classification of garbage in 7 classes, we should add 1 more class containing random images. This is intended to make the model more accurate. If there is no negative/different data, it is feared that the model will force the prediction to be one of the 7 classes, even though the testing image is not one of the 7 classes.
